# 🌉 SkillBridge: Autonomous Career Agent (Google ADK + Gemini)


## Overview

SkillBridge is an intelligent, multi-agent system designed to automate the complex process of career pivoting. Built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and powered by Gemini 2.0, it acts as a personalized career coach.

The system autonomously reads a user's resume, analyzes the target job market, identifies critical skill gaps, generates a 4-week aggressive study plan, and iteratively rewrites the professional summary until it meets strict ATS (Applicant Tracking System) standards.
